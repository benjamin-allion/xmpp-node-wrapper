summary: Sync avatars between vCards and PEP

## Introduction

This module pushes the users nickname and avatar from vCards into PEP,
or into vCards from PEP. This allows interop between older clients that
use [XEP-0153: vCard-Based Avatars] to see the avatars of clients that
use [XEP-0084: User Avatar] and vice versa.

Also see [XEP-0398: User Avatar to vCard-Based Avatars Conversion].
