summary: Keepalive s2s connections
...

Introduction
============

This module periodically sends [XEP-0199] ping requests to remote servers
to keep your connection alive.

Configuration
=============

Simply add the module to the `modules_enabled` list like any other
module. By default, all current s2s connections will be pinged
periodically. To ping only a subset of servers, list these in
`keepalive_servers`. The ping interval can be set using
`keepalive_interval`.

``` lua
modules_enabled = {
    ...
    "s2s_keepalive"
}

keepalive_servers = { "conference.prosody.im"; "rooms.swift.im" }
keepalive_interval = "300" -- (in seconds, default is 60 )
```
