summary: Subscribe to Atom and RSS feeds over pubsub
---

# Introduction

This module allows Prosody to fetch Atom and RSS feeds for you, and push
new results to subscribers over XMPP.

# Configuration

This module needs to be be loaded together with
[mod\_pubsub][doc:modules:mod\_pubsub].

For example, this is how you could add it to an existing pubsub
component:

``` lua
Component "pubsub.example.com" "pubsub"
modules_enabled = { "pubsub_feeds" }

feeds = {
  -- The part before = is used as PubSub node
  planet_jabber = "http://planet.jabber.org/atom.xml";
  prosody_blog = "http://blog.prosody.im/feed/atom.xml";
}
```

This example creates two nodes, 'planet\_jabber' and 'prosody\_blog'
that clients can subscribe to using
[XEP-0060](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html). Results are in
[ATOM 1.0 format](http://atomenabled.org/) for easy consumption.

# PubSubHubbub

This module also implements a
[PubSubHubbub](http://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pubsubhubbub-core-0.3.html)
subscriber. This allows feeds that have an associated "hub" to push
updates when they are published.

Not all feeds support this.

It needs to expose a HTTP callback endpoint to work.
