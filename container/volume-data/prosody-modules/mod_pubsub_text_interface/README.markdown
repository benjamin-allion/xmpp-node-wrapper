# Introduction

This module lets you manage subscriptions to pubsub nodes via simple
chat messages. Subscriptions are always added based on bare JID. The
`include_body` flag is enabled so that a plain text body version of events
can be included, where supported.

# Configuring

```lua
Component "pubsub.example.com" "pubub"
modules_enabled = {
    "pubsub_text_interface",
}
```

# Commands

The following commands are supported. Simply send a normal chat message
to the PubSub component where this module is enabled. When subscribing
or unsubscribing, be sure to replace `node` with the node you want to
subscribe to or unsubscribe from.

- `help` - a help message, listing these commands
- `list` - list available nodes
- `subscribe node` - subscribe to a node
- `unsubscribe node` - unsubscribe from a node
